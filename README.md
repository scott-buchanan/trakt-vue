# Vue 3 with Trakt, TMDB, OMDb and fanart.tv 

Personal project to get more familiar with Vue 3. Using Trakt, TMDB, fanart, OMDb API's.

- View Trakt trending shows/movies
- View Trakt shows recommended by you
- View episode watched history
- Search for TV Shows and Movies (with autocomplete)
- Rate episodes, shows, movies (Trakt)
- Read Reviews for episodes, shows, movies
- View list of actors for episodes, shows, movies

## Upcoming features
- Movies (WIP)
- Mobile support
- Write reviews
- Rate episode/show/movie will also push to TMDB
- List seasons in TV Show details
- Actors section (instead of linking off to IMDb)

More will be added to this list as I think of things to add.
